# TunisiaScraper
This small project is my first web scraping one. What it does is simple, it scrapes jobs and ultimately, it output a bar graph that lists the top skills mentionned in job descriptions.

First, tunjobs and berlinjobs scripts are used to scrape web pages and save text data into seperate csv files. Afterwards, the plotting script will read the data and use the collections to determine the frequency of each specified programming skill.
